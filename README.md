I have uploaded a video of my game in the name of "BallGame_HackerMode"
 
Task 2 : ColorSwitch (HACKER Mode)

Code which I did for my college club induction: Task 2 : 

Problem Statement:

Bharath has found his speed tester, and has assigned him his work. Bharath now sits free, with plenty of time in his hands. So he intends to play a game to pass his time. Unbeknownst to even his close friends Bharath (aka Mr. Gray) actually loves colors. Help him paint his playroom similar to this so he remains engaged while his junior completes the task.

Hacker mode:(Requirements)

 (i)   Update the high scores in real time.
 
 (ii)  Have more than two colours and add a mechanism to switch the colour of the ball.
 
 (iii) Make buttons to pause and resume the game at any point.
 
 (iv)  Increase game difficulty by increasing the speed of rotation and direction of movement of obstacles.
